## Snake Game in Python

Project Name: SnakeGame

Description:
SnakeGame is a classic arcade game implemented in Python. This project is designed to help beginners learn fundamental concepts of game development using Python and the Pygame library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

Features:
- Game Screen: A simple graphical interface displaying the snake, food, and the game area.
- Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- Food Generation: Randomly places food items on the screen for the snake to eat.
- Score Display: Keeps track of the player's score, increasing with each food item eaten.
- Game Over: Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the walls, displaying the final score.
- Restart Option: Allows the player to restart the game after a game over.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pygame library for graphics and game development

Learning Outcomes:
- Setting up a game loop to manage game states and updates.
- Handling user input for controlling the game character.
- Implementing collision detection between game objects.
- Using basic graphics to render game elements.
- Managing game state transitions and displaying score information.

This description outlines the key features and learning objectives for developing the Snake game in Python, providing a clear and engaging project for beginners.
